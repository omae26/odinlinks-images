        <!--The link isn't working obviously, because it lacks an html attribute which gives the link's destinatiion -->
        <!-- An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the elementâ€™s opening tag. -->
         <!-- An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value -->
          <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
          <!-- The value of the href attribute is the destination you want your link to go to. -->

        <!-- If you want to use the dog image in the about page You would first have to go up one level out of 
         the pages directory into its parent directory so you could then access the images directory. -->
         <!-- To go to the parent directory you need to use two dots in the relative filepath like this: ../. -->
        <!-- <img src="../.images/dog.jpg"> -->

        <!-- Alt attribute (Alternative text)-->
        <!-- Besides the src attribute, every image element should have an alt attribute -->
         <!-- The alt attribute is used to describe an image -->
          <!--  It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. -->
            <!-- It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users. -->

<!-- There are 2 types of links: Relative and Absolute -->

<!-- Absolute links -->
 <!-- Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links -->
  <!-- An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination. -->
   <!-- i.e protocol://domain/path. e.g https://www.theodinproject.com/about -->

<!-- Relative links -->
<!-- Links to other pages within your own website are called relative links. -->
 <!-- Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, 
  it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page you created the link on. -->
  <!-- Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on -->
