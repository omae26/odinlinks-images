        <!--The link isn't working obviously, because it lacks an html attribute which gives the link's destinatiion -->
        <!-- An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the elementâ€™s opening tag. -->
         <!-- An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value -->
          <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
          <!-- The value of the href attribute is the destination you want your link to go to. -->
           <!-- By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without an href attribute will look like plain text -->
            <!-- This is an absolute link -->

<!-- There are 2 types of links: Relative and Absolute -->

<!-- Absolute links -->
 <!-- Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links -->
  <!-- An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination. -->
   <!-- i.e protocol://domain/path. e.g https://www.theodinproject.com/about -->

<!-- Relative links -->
<!-- Links to other pages within your own website are called relative links. -->
 <!-- Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, 
  it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page you created the link on. -->
  <!-- Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on -->
